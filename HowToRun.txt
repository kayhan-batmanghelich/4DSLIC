- Do not decreases cubeness value below 1 b/c it crashes ! I have not resolves the issue yet.
- Instead you can play with magnitude of the vector image.
- Here is how I got some reasonable results:
      ./scalarListImgToVecImg scalarImg.lst vecImg.nii.gz magImg.nii.gz 100
      ./supervoxel_test  vecImg.nii.gz labelImg.nii.gz  10  10
